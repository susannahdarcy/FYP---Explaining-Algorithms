This is the code repository for Susannah D'Arcy's final year project. The project goals was to create an interface to aid in the understanding of algorithms, and their trade-offs.
In this repository we have:

- Report.pdf: The full report
- Model Generation.ipynb: jupyter notebook displaying how the models were generated and developed.
- Website: Code used to generate the interface with Flasks, and JS.
